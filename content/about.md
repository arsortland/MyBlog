{{< /rawhtml >}}


I consider myself being a tech enthusiast and loves to learn new things in everything tech.

On a daily basis I work as a Cloud consultant mainly focusing on Azure.

But I enjoy learning more about things in many fields like AI, LLM, app development, infrastructure, network, security, hacking, pentesting and alot more.
So I thought it would be a cool idea to have a place for myself to document some of the things im doing and learning.

I might accidentaly help someone else or inspire you to learn something new aswell?

Either way thanks for sticking around. Hope you find something useful here.

With kind regards,

André
